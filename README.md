# my_data

Apps and services online grab, use and sell your data all the time. However, thanks to privacy acts, you can request a copy of all the data they have collected from you.

Unfortunately, this data is very hard to read and understand for the average person. This project aims to make it easier to understand the data you have collected, and gives helpful analytics and notes on e.g. who Instagram has sold your data to.
